# Creating a .NET MAUI Doughnut Chart with Maps to Visualize the Top Cities with the Most Skyscrapers

## Description
Data visualization is an essential part of modern applications, and combining charts with maps can elevate the user experience by providing geographic context to your data. In this blog, we’ll explore how to create a Semi-Doughnut Chart with integrated Maps using Syncfusion [Circular Chart](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-circular-charts) and [Maps](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-maps) controls in .NET MAUI.

## Circular Chart
The Circular Chart is a versatile control that represents data in a circular format. A [semi-doughnut chart](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/circular-charts/doughnutchart#semi-doughnut), a variation of the doughnut chart, displays data in a semi-circle, making it ideal for use cases where screen space is limited or you want to combine charts with other visual elements.

## Map
The [Maps](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/maps/overview) Control in Syncfusion allows developers to integrate rich geographic data visualizations into their .NET MAUI applications. You can add layers, markers, and shapes to create interactive maps that pair perfectly with your chart data.

In today’s urban landscape, skyscrapers symbolize innovation, architectural prowess, and economic strength. To showcase cities with the most skyscrapers, we will use .NET MAUI to create an interactive doughnut chart paired with maps. This integration not only highlights statistical data but also provides geographic context, making it easier to grasp insights at a glance.
